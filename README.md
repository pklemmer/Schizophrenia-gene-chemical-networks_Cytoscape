# Schizophrenia-gene-chemical-networks_Cytoscape
R script and repo to dynamically fetch gene-disease associations from [Wikipathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/), [DisGeNET](https://www.disgenet.org/), and a publication by [Trubetskoy et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5) that are harmonised and merged into one network. Network is then clustered and undergoes [GO analysis](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost) and then extended with key events, adverse outcome pathways, and adverse outcomes from [AOP-Wiki](https://aopwiki.org/). Finally, the network is extended with chemical-target data from [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/). Script is used to automate Cytoscape actions and makes SPARQL queries to the above-mentioned databases for data retrieval.
