# SCZ-CNV
Repo to automatically overlap schizophrenia copy number variation pathways with common drug pathways

R script to automatically import Wikipathways (wikipathways.com) molecular pathways by keyword and species, and detect intersections between pathways. Script interacts with Cytoscape (cytoscape.org) API through RCy3 package. 
Can be used to detect intersection (overlap) between two or more pathways and extract overlapping nodes into a table.
