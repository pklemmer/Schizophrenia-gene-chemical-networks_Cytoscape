Activation of MEK-ERK1/2 leads to deficits in learning and cognition via ROS and apoptosis
Binding of agonists to ionotropic glutamate receptors in adult brain causes excitotoxicity that mediates neuronal cell death, contributing to learning and memory impairment.
Binding of electrophilic chemicals to SH(thiol)-group of proteins and /or to seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress during brain development leads to impairment of learning and memory
Chronic binding of antagonist to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities
Chronic binding of antagonist to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development leads to neurodegeneration with impairment in learning and memory in aging
Co-activation of IP3R and RyR leads to economic burden through reduced IQ and non-cholinergic mechanisms
Deposition of Energy Leading to Learning and Memory Impairment
Inhibition of Na+/I- symporter (NIS) leads to learning and memory impairment
Interference with thyroid serum binding protein transthyretin and subsequent adverse human neurodevelopmental toxicity
